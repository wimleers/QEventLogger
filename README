How to use in your Qt application
---------------------------------

1) Add the QEventLogger.h and QEventLogger.cpp files to your project, and add
   them to your .pro file.
2) Subclass QApplication, e.g. in the MyApplication class.
3) Include QEventLogger.h in MyApplication.h and add a QEventLogger member:
     QEventLogger * eventLogger;
4) In the MyApplication constructor, initialize the event logger and install
   it as an event filter (the first parameter is the basename of the
   resulting log files, the second parameter is a pointer to the app's
   main window, the dimensions of which will be logged as well, the third
   parameter disables/enables screenshots to be taken for each logged event):
     this->eventLogger = new QEventLogger("./events", this->mainWindow, true);
     this->installEventFilter(this->eventLogger);
5) When you now build your application, you will get .csv files in the same
   directory as the application binary, with filenames such as
   "events 2010-10-29T20-29-17.csv".
   If the screenshot mode is enabled, a directory with a filename such as
   "screenshots 2010-10-29T20-29-17" will be created in the current directory.
   Within that directory, PNG files can be found with filenames such as
   "12345.png", where the number in the filename indicates the relative time
   at which the screenshot is made.
